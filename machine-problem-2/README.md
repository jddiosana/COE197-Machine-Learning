#### Install
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Run Project
To run project:

`cd \COE197-Machine-Learning\machine-problem-2`

`python solver.py`

To show plots for training losses, train data vs. predicted data, test data vs. predicted data:

 `python solver.py --show_plot`
 
 A Jupyter notebook version is also available to show the processes of loading data, preprocessing data, training model, fitting model and evaluating the model equation.
