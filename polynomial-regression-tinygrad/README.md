#### About
This is a polynomial solver program using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in TinyGrad framework. A k-fold cross validation technique is also used to evaluate the model performance given the limited data.

#### Install
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Run Project
To run project:

`cd \COE197-Machine-Learning\machine-problem-2`

`python solver.py`

To show plots for training losses, train data vs. predicted data, test data vs. predicted data:

 `python solver.py --show_plot`
 
 A Jupyter notebook version [solver.ipynb](https://github.com/jddiosana/COE197-Machine-Learning/blob/master/machine-problem-2/solver.ipynb) is also available to show the processes of loading data, preprocessing data, training model, fitting model and evaluating the model equation.
